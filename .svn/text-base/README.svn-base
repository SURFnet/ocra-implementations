INFO
====
This project contains example implementations of the OATH OCRA Challenge 
Response algorithm for various languages.

All of the implementations are initially based on the reference 
implementation from version 13 of the draft.

The current draft of the OCRA standard:

http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-mraihi-mutual-oath-hotp-variants-13

Versions currently exist for:

* Java
* Objective-C
* PHP

Each of these come with a simplistic rudimentary unit test.
